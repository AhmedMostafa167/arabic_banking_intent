# Improvement log

Each entry records one measured change to the intent classifier: what was measured, the
prediction written before the run, the numbers, and the decision taken because of them.
Entries are in the order the work happened.

## Entry 1 — Baseline, and what the official validation split's leak costs (planned)

**Question.** 94% of the official validation versions have a version of the same question in
train (`notebooks/01_explore_data.ipynb`, part 2). How much does that inflate a score?

**Measure.** The TF-IDF + logistic regression baseline, macro-F1:

- **A:** trained on the official train file, scored on the official validation file;
- **B:** trained on our train split, scored on our validation split (grouped by question);
- both also scored on the official MSA and Palestinian test sets, which neither has seen.

**Prediction (2026-10-24, before any run).** The leak will not change the TF-IDF baseline's
score noticeably: A − B will be a random difference, not a real one. Tested as: the gap is no
larger than the noise floor measured in step 2.

**Result.** Pending (step 2).
